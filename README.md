Chicago Commercial Restroom Standard (CRC)

A public benchmark for commercial restroom operations in Chicago.
This repository hosts the Chicago Restroom Compliance Score (CRC) — a simple, browser-based evaluation tool that helps building owners, facility managers, and commercial cleaning companies understand whether their restroom cleaning program meets Chicago-grade expectations.

Chicago has unique operational challenges. High-density traffic, mixed-use buildings, weather-driven debris, and strict tenant expectations make generic national checklists unreliable.
The CRC Score was created to provide ONE clear standard that reflects how restrooms actually function in Chicago.

🚻 What This Repository Includes

1. The CRC Score Calculator (Live Tool)

A client-facing, interactive estimator that generates a 0–100 compliance score.
It evaluates:
	•	Facility type
	•	Daily restroom traffic
	•	Full-clean and touch-up frequency
	•	Deep clean recency
	•	High-touch disinfection
	•	Odor control
	•	Documentation quality

The calculator is intentionally simple, mobile-friendly, and fast.
It does not store data — it is a directional assessment to help Chicago buildings understand where they stand.

2. Chicago as the Standard

Chicago buildings operate under real conditions that national checklists ignore:
	•	Higher daily restroom traffic
	•	Weather debris (salt, rain, slush, dust)
	•	Mixed retail + office + restaurant foot traffic
	•	Tenants with near-zero tolerance for odor or inconsistency

This project treats restroom cleaning as a system, not a chore list.

The CRC helps building teams and cleaning companies speak the same language:

“Is this restroom Chicago-ready?”

🧹 For Building Owners & Facility Managers

If you manage:
	•	Office towers
	•	Corporate campuses
	•	Retail malls
	•	Restaurants
	•	Medical clinics
	•	Gyms or fitness centers

…the CRC Score gives you a fast, standardized way to evaluate operational risk.

Low CRC scores often correlate with:
	•	Odor complaints
	•	Tenant dissatisfaction
	•	Slower lease renewals
	•	Higher long-term maintenance costs

High CRC scores correlate with:
	•	Cleanliness consistency
	•	Fewer complaints
	•	Better tenant retention
	•	Predictable operations

⸻

🧽 For Commercial Cleaning Companies

The CRC is a competitive advantage.

Instead of claiming your service is “thorough,” you can speak in measurable terms:
	•	Recommended vs actual frequencies
	•	Deep-clean cadence
	•	High-touch coverage
	•	Risk areas
	•	Documentation strength

A strong CRC score helps prove accountability and Chicago-standard readiness.
